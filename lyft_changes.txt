This file tracks the changes we have pushed to lyft-master but not apache/incubator-superset master.
lyft-master is a branch in a Lyft fork of apache/incubator-superset that has cherries applied to it.
Since then, we have modified these "cherries" and/or added files. Please add changes done to this
file to help us track how close or far we are from apache/incubator-superset master.

1. Kepler changes
- @superset-ui/legacy-preset-chart-kepler has been added to package.json
- webpack.config.js has been updated to tell Babel not to parse files in the type-analyzer package
  because it contains CommonJS files. If Babel parses such files, it will mix require and export
  default in a module, which is not allowed.
